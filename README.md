# name-generator-mongoose
This node.js module has two parts. The first part imports a large number of first & last names into the user's MongoDB using Mongoose. The data includes a popularity field to allow filtering based on a name's popularity. It also includes a gender binary field ("M" or "F") for first names.

npm package URL: https://www.npmjs.com/package/name-generator-mongoose

## Setup
Install using npm:
`npm install name-generator-mongoose --save`

Connect to your database using Mongoose (outside of the scope of these instructions).

Import module:
`const ng = require("name-generator-mongoose");`

*Note: Check out the included example.js for a complete script*

## Import Data
To import the data, you can run the importNames function that returns a Promise:
```
const ng = require("name-generator-mongoose");
ng.importNames().then(() => {
    console.log("The names have been imported");
};
```

You only need to import once (in fact, if it notices data already in the collection, it will stop itself from importing so as to not cause duplicates).

## Generating a Random Name
The most basic command is getting a random name name from the entire database:

```
const ng = require("name-generator-mongoose");
ng.generateName().then((name) => {
    console.log(`${name.firstName} ${name.surname} - ${name.gender}`);
    mongoose.disconnect();
}).catch((err) => {
    console.error(err);
});
```

To filter by gender or popularity, you can add in an options object:

```
// This would filter only female first names and \
// use only top 100 most popular first & last names
options = {
    gender: "F",
    top: 100,
};
ng.generateName(options).then((name) => {
    console.log(`${name.firstName} ${name.surname} - ${name.gender}`);
    mongoose.disconnect();
}).catch((err) => {
    console.error(err);
});
```

## Data Attributions
The surname data comes from FiveThirtyEight: https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data

The first name data comes from the US Social Security Office: https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/background.html

## Using Your Own Data
You can overwrite surname.csv and firstname.csv to include your own data. The format is:
```
// firstname.csv
name,gender('M'/'F'),popularity(int)

//surname.csv
name,,popularity(int)
```

##Accessing Models
If you need access to the mongoose models, you can access as such:
```
const ng = require("name-generator-mongoose");
const firstNameModel = ng.FirstName
const surnameModel = ng.Surname
```
